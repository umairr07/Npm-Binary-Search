# Binary Search Algorithm NPM Package

## Introduction

This npm package provides a simple and efficient implementation of the binary search algorithm. Binary search is a classic algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, making it highly efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install binaryy-searchh-npm
```
